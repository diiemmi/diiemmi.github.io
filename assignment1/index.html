    <p>1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?
        </p>
    <p>The first thing that caught my eye when I interacted with the website was the selection of music or sounds. One of the classical pieces that linked with it was "Dvořák: Symphony No. 7 in D Minor, Op. 70, B. 141 - III. Scherzo. Vivace." This symphony's rich and dramatic orchestration provided a captivating audio backdrop, elevating the total experience to a level of sophistication and depth. A feeling of cultural significance was evoked by the selection of classical music, which provided a touch of delicacy and elegance. In addition to increasing my connection with the website, its presence gave the browsing experience an air of magnitude and artistic appreciation from the beginning.
