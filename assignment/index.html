    <h1>Frank Gehry</h1>
    <main class="container1">
    <h2>1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?
    </h2>
    <p>The first thing that caught my eye when I interacted with the website was the selection of music or sounds. One of the classical pieces that linked with it was "Dvořák: Symphony No. 7 in D Minor, Op. 70, B. 141 - III. Scherzo. Vivace." This symphony's rich and dramatic orchestration provided a captivating audio backdrop, elevating the total experience to a level of sophistication and depth. A feeling of cultural significance was evoked by the selection of classical music, which provided a touch of delicacy and elegance. In addition to increasing my connection with the website, its presence gave the browsing experience an air of magnitude and artistic appreciation from the beginning.

   <h2>2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.
    </h2>
    <p><ul>
        <li>Scrolling down: My main method of interacting with the website was to scroll down, which triggered dynamic responses and revealed various areas and information as I navigated through it. With each downward movement on the page, this action enhanced the surfing experience by activating interesting interactions and motion graphics in addition to making the journey through material easier.</li>
        <li>Observing moving parts and interactions: With the classical music playing in the background, I observed a lot of dynamic features and interactions as I scrolled, which added visual interest and engagement to the experience.</li>
        <li>Watching the video: I spent some time watching the website's video material, which was an interview with Frank Gehry that provided more context and insights into the significance of the Walt Disney Concert Hall</li>
        <li>Examining the concert hall virtual model: I explored the model, clicking on various sections to examine the design features and comprehend their function within the architectural framework.</li>
        <li>Tapping the menu: I used the menu function to go between the website's chapters, which allowed me to access relevant content and better manage my browsing experience quickly.</li></ul>
    </p> </main>
    <main class="container3">
    <h2>3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?
    </h2>
        <p>The part of the experience that occupied up most of my time was exploring the model aspect. This section made it possible to examine several components in detail, which helped to comprehend the complexities involved fully. The ability to interact with the models—clicking on particular features to reveal related information—was especially interesting because it deepened the exploration process. This part of the experience was fascinating and educational due to the combination of useful material and visual depiction, which compelled me to learn more about the Concert Hall and its intentionally intricate architectural structure and design that brings life to art.</p></main>
    <main class="container4">
        <h2>4. What was the most common action in your two-minute interaction with the experience?
    </h2>
        <p>During my two minutes with the experience, scrolling was the most common behaviour. The website's dynamic design, which saw a lot of moving pieces and content elements appear and disappear as I navigated down the page, made this activity happen frequently. Videos and information started to appear virtually on their own, adding to the interactive aspect of the browsing experience. The smoothness of the scrolling mechanism made it easy to navigate through the material and ensured that users could interact with all of the elements that were displayed on the website. This meant users immersed themselves in the website as it took them through the Concert Hall and its many offerings and ingenious mechanisms. </p></main>
    <main class="container5">
        <h2>5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?
    </h2>
        <p>I believe that the main objective of the interactive experience is to fully immerse the user in the culture. The website seems to be made with the intention of giving visitors an immersive and unique look into cultural components, most likely those regarding music, architecture, or other artistic pursuits. The interactive experience attempts to immerse visitors in a realm of cultural appreciation and comprehension using interactive elements including virtual models, dynamic content, and rich multimedia presentations. A sense of connection and appreciation for the cultural issues the website investigates appears to be fostered by delivering a combination of visual, audio, and interactive stimuli.</p></main>
    <main class="container6">
        <h2>6. How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
    </h2>
        <p>The interactive experience, which mimics a virtual tour guide, successfully conveys its main objective of captivating users in culture. Users are guided around the website with minimum clicking and smooth navigation, enabling a fluid and immersive exploration of the cultural content presented. The layout makes it easy to navigate through different cultural elements, such as masterpieces of architecture, musical compositions, or other cultural artefacts, much like being guided by an informed guide would. This method guarantees that visitors won't be distracted by difficult navigation and can concentrate on taking in the depth of the content, which will improve their overall experience and comprehension of the cultural issues covered.
    </p></main>
    <main class="container7">
    <h2>7. What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)
    </h2>
        <p>In my opinion, it is best to approach the interactive experience in chronological order during the first interaction. To obtain a thorough comprehension of the material, users should engage with each component as they scroll across the page. Users are able to fully immerse themselves in the experience and recognise the connectivity of various cultural elements during this initial exploration. After that, visitors can return to the website more than once, using the menu bar to go to particular areas of interest for additional research. Users can explore specific areas of the text more thoroughly due to this iterative method, which gradually improves their comprehension and appreciation. Users can get more out of their interactions and get more out of returning by combining focused navigation with chronological exploration.
    </p></main>
    <main class="container8">
    <h2>8. How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?
    </h2>
        <p>Through a number of features and functionalities, the interactive experience gradually conveys how it should be used. The navigation buttons on the website enable users to access to specific sections or information, which in turn allows for targeted research and the ability to concentrate on areas of interest on follow-up visits. Furthermore, the ability to exit the video interview and go back to the main page, similar to when viewing the model, gives users more freedom and control, letting them customise their engagement to suit their needs and agendas. These components show that the website is made to support many levels of interaction and invite visitors to come back and interact with the material in a way that best fits their unique requirements and preferences over time.
        </p></main>
    <main class="container9">
        <h2>9. What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h2>
        <p>The website incorporates video into the experience as it adds both visual and audio elements. They provide further context, explanations, and stories about the culture and history of the Concert Hall and the works of Frank Gehry. Users can explore architectural or cultural components in a dynamic and immersive way by using interactive 3D models, which enable a thorough analysis of design elements and spatial interactions. Additionally, the inclusion of motion graphics gives the experience a dynamic visual element that improves user engagement and provides visual appeal while consumers interact with the material. These many media formats enhance the multi-sensory and captivating experience by giving visitors a range of ways to engage with and delve into the creative process of Frank Gehry.
    </p></main>
    <main class="container10">
    <h2>10. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?
    </h2>
        <p>The interactive experience's reference to several media formats makes it clear to me how crucial it is to make sure visitors interacting with my research experience have a smooth and simple navigation experience. I can design an environment that is dynamic and captivating, encouraging user discovery and engagement, by integrating components like motion graphics, 3D modelling, and video content. It also emphasises how important it is to have self-explanatory navigation tools and features that allow people to go around the material with ease. This suggests that in order to increase user satisfaction and engagement, the website must be designed with user-friendliness in mind, with the goal of making browsing as easy and intuitive as possible.
    </p></main>
    <main class="container11">
     <h2>11. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?
    </h2>
        <p>It is important to take the user's experience into account with empathy and understanding. I should use a similar approach to my research, acknowledging that users may differ in their needs, preferences, and degree of expertise with the topic. This implies that I should make an effort to design a user-friendly, inclusive, and accessible research experience by considering the perspectives and experiences of all possible users. It also highlights how crucial it is to pay close attention to the views and concerns of users and modify the research experience as necessary to make sure that it fulfils their requirements and expectations.

    <main class="container12">
    <h2>12. What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?
    </h2>
        <p>The website's design, which consists of a single, lengthy scrollable page, was the aspect of the interaction that I found most frustrating. It became difficult to browse efficiently and find relevant information without clear divisions or sections. Because there was so much information, it was hard to concentrate on any one piece because it all seemed to blur together due to the lack of organisation. Furthermore, the lack of pauses or transitions between sections made it more difficult for me to follow my location on the website and assess my progress, which frustrated and disoriented me. Overall, the continuous scrolling structure of the website hindered navigation and made it difficult to effectively interact with the content, which negatively impacted the user experience overall.
    </p></main>
    <main class="container13">
    <h2>13. What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?
    </h2>
        <p>The website's dynamic response as I scrolled down, especially the sensation of zooming in closer to the building as I went, was the most satisfying aspect of the interaction for me. This interactive element made browsing more engaging and immersive by bringing an engaging and visually stunning environment to the screen. The website moved in unison with my scrolling movements, giving me a sensation of responsiveness and control and heightening the sense of exploration and discovery. Furthermore, by enabling a closer look at certain architectural details and design aspects, the zooming effect enhanced the viewing experience by adding depth and richness. All in all, this interactive feature enhanced the overall immersive and rewarding engagement, adding to the enjoyment and memorability of the browsing experience.
